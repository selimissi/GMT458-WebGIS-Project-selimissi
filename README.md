## 📖 Abstract & Project Overview
**Ready for Departure** is a Full-Stack Web GIS application designed to simulate air traffic control operations. The system challenges players to manage flight paths using real-world coordinates (WGS84) on an interactive map.

Unlike traditional web applications, this project integrates **Spatial Database** capabilities with a **Node.js** backend to perform real-time proximity analysis, geofencing, and trajectory validation. The entire infrastructure is deployed on a cloud server, mimicking a production-ready environment.

## 🎯 Implementation & Scoring Claims
This project fulfills the advanced requirements set by the GMT 458 curriculum, based on the following modules:

### 1. ☁️ Cloud Hosting & DevOps
* **Infrastructure:** Deployed on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** EC2 instance (Region: eu-north-1 / Stockholm).
* **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Linux).
* **Process Management:** Utilized **PM2** for daemonizing the Node.js application, ensuring 99.9% uptime, load balancing, and automatic restarts.
* **Network Security:** Configured AWS Security Groups to manage Inbound/Outbound traffic rules (Port 3000/80).

### 2. 🗄️ NoSQL Database Implementation (25%)
* **Technology:** **MongoDB Atlas** (Cloud-managed Cluster).
* **Why NoSQL?** Flight logs, user sessions, and geospatial data generate heterogeneous structures. MongoDB's document-based model offers superior flexibility compared to rigid relational tables (SQL).
* **Spatial Optimization:** Utilized `2dsphere` indexes to execute high-performance spatial queries (e.g., `$near`, `$geoIntersects`).

**Database Evidence:**
*Real-time data storage of registered users and flight logs on MongoDB Atlas:*

### 3. 👥 Managing Different User Types (20%)
* **Architecture:** The system implements a hierarchical Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* **Implemented Roles:**
    1.  **Guest:** Restricted access (Read-Only). Can interact with the map and play, but cannot create persistent data records.
    2.  **Registered User:** Standard access. Authorized to perform CRUD operations on flight logs and save high scores to the database.
    3.  **Administrator:** Elevated privileges. Capable of overseeing system integrity and user management operations.

### 4. 🚀 Performance Testing
* **Tool:** **Artillery.io** (Load Testing Framework).
* **Methodology:** Simulated high-concurrency traffic (simultaneous users) to stress-test the AWS instance and Node.js event loop.
* **Results:** The server handled ~600 requests/min with **zero failures** and an average latency of **70ms**.

### 5. 🔐 Authentication & Security (15%)
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Implemented stateless authentication for secure session management.
* **Encryption:** Passwords are hashed using **Bcrypt.js** with salt rounds before storage.
* **Secure Headers:** API utilizes standard security headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

### 6. 🔌 API Development
* **Architecture:** Robust RESTful API built with **Express.js**.
* **Key Endpoints:**
    * `GET /api/users/leaderboard` - Fetches global rankings.
    * `POST /api/auth/register` - Handles user creation and validation.
    * `POST /api/score/update` - Securely commits game scores.
    * `GET /api/airports` - Serves GeoJSON data for map rendering.
